Key takeaways:
Baking soda makes the starch of the potatoes on the outside break down and it makes this meshy texture. When roasted that texture gives it insane crunchyness. [Noice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3uBr0CCm58)
Rosemary - not my thing, makes it too herby idk. 
I recommend Garlic, Salt, Black Pepper, Red Paprika. Something like that.

It does take a lot of work and time for the whole process. It uses alot of utensils as well. I guess with practice it will be faster.

The boiling does the cooking so make sure you pre-heat your oven on ${250}^\circ C$ and just roast them until they are brown and crunchy.
